## Project Overview
The primary emphasis of this project is to create an application that leverages the GitHub repository search API to search, filter, and sort GitHub repositories.

Upon loading the application, our user will see the search interface. To search for GitHub repositories by topic, input the topic into the search input and clicking search. The user can also filter their search by language, by clicking the language tag, the user will see a language input that will filter their search results by the selected language. If you would like to sort their results by the number of stars, they can achieve that by clicking on the stars tag, entering a topic, and pressing search.

Once a search is complete, you will see your search results at the bottom of the page. You can see more details about a specific repository by clicking on the results card. If this is not the repository that you are looking for, you can always return to the results by clicking the back button on the details page.
